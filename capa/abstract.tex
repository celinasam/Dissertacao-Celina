%\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
  The data in a reliable distributed system should be available when
  needed. Erasure codes have been used by systems to meet reliability
  requirements and reduce the cost of data storage. The Hadoop is a
  framework for running applications on distributed storage of large
  volumes of data and it can be built with commodity hardware, which
  is easily accessible and available. This proposal will examine the
  feasibility of practical implementation of erasure coding techniques
  in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), changes in Hadoop and
  effectiveness of those changes. This proposal is a contribution to
  free software in distributed systems.
